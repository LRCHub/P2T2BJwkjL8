夢の後先へ
夜明けの陽が眩しくて
またいつかなって笑い
道はどこかへ続き
くだら無い事で笑い
くだら無い事で泣いた
今だってそうだろう
We had to say good bye
Nothing's good to me
Nothing's changing
Time's just passing
Nothing's changing
Last days of our youth
All of us were growing
White snow's falling
Covers slowly
Those days calling
And it's glowing
Last days of our youth
All of us were growing
Don't let me down
白く世界は染まり
降り積もってくsnow snow snow
I'll be waiting there you know
Don't take me back
Cause I will find
Find it out as I go go go
All the answer on this road
♪♪♪
風は止み 月は
はしゃぐ僕らを照らし
調子ハズレのsoul beat
掻き鳴らしてたheart beat
それぞれの日々は颯
憶いでの欠片合わせ
つながっていたかった
We had to say good bye
Nothing's good to me
Nothing's changing
Time's just passing
Nothing's changing
Last days of our youth
All of us were growing
White snow's falling
Covers slowly
Those days calling
And it's glowing
Last days of our youth
All of us were growing
Don't let me down
呼び覚ましてmemories
目を閉じればsnow snow snow
I'll be waiting there you know
Don't take me back
Cause I will find
Find it out as I go go go
